Introduction 
==================================
Our program procedurally generates tree models that are composed of cylinders connected to each other, with texture-mapped bark and leaves. Users can choose to generate trees using an L-system generation algorithm or a space colonization generation algorithm. Trees of different shapes and sizes can be generated by changing various parameters. Within the L-system generation algorithm, users can vary the recursion depth, initial height, number of circle points within each cylinder, number of branch sections, phenotype, and branch callback function of their trees. There is also an option to generate “autumn” trees with leaves that are red, orange, and yellow instead of green. Within the space colonization algorithm, users can vary the number of anchor points, height, radius, number of circle points within each cylinder, tree node distance, kill distance, branch initial radius, radius growth, attraction radius, leafiness, and discount rate of their trees. With all the different parameter options, a near infinite number of unique trees can be generated. Users have the additional option to generate an orchard with the tree models they create and grow different "fruit" from the trees.


Specification

**Features of the program:**

1. A user interface with the following tabs:
    1. L-system tab
        1. Recursion depth: Number of levels of recursion we will take our L-system through
        2. Initial height of tree
        3. Circle points: How round the cylinders that make up the tree will be
        4. Branch sections: How many cylindric sections are added to each branch
        5. Phenotype: What type of tree is generated
        6. Generate button to run the program
    2. Space colonization tab
        1. Anchor count: Number of initial anchor points

        5. Distance between tree nodes
        6. Kill distance for anchor nodes
        7. Initial branch tip radius: Each branch radius is defined by the radii of its children, so we add a parameter to specify the radius of a branch with no children
        8. Branch radius growth factor: Specific constant in definition of branch radius used by space colonization algorithm; higher constants lead to slower growth
        9. Attraction radius: Radius within which anchor points can attract nodes

2. In all tabs, when the "Generate" button is pressed, the program:
    1. Immediately displays a waiting screen
    2. Generates a tree/orchard with the specificed parameters
    3. Saves the generated model/scene to a file and loads the scene

Topic Overview 
==================================
**Tree Generation using L-Systems**

L-systems provide an easy way to generate plantlike structures. Nature often encorporates fractal patterns in how plants grow and branch, which translates easily into recursive method calls which mirror such growth on a mesh (1).

![Fractals in Nature [#Wikipedia]](doc-files/plantFractal.png width=800)

In order to set up this generation, a set of simple recusive rules must be written. These generally replace or grow a set of smaller branches off of a parent branch, and can be applied repeatedly to get increasingly detailed results. [#Wikipedia]

![Products of L-Systems [#Wikipedia]](doc-files/L-SystemProducts.jpg width=800)

**Tree Generation using Space Colonization**

Space Colonization is an algorithm that attempts to model the competition by branches for space on a tree in its generation. It does a better job than L-Systems at modeling mature trees, since as plant mature, the factors limiting their growth start to weigh more heavily on how branches are placed than the factors creating opportunites for growth (2).

![Tree generated with Space Colonization [#Runions]](doc-files/SpaceColonizationTree.jpg width=800)

The algorithm works by randomly seeding a volume with anchor points, which pull on tree nodes, spawning adjacent tree nodes in the average direction of the anchor points pulling on that node. Once a tree node gets too close to an anchor node, than anchor is destroyed. This process repeats until all anchors are destroyed. [#Runions]

To avoid having a lengthy App class, we abstracted our tree generation into two different classes, LGenerator, which generates an L-system tree, and SCGenerator, which generates a space colonization tree.

The LGenerator has two main functions for tree generation, `makeLTreeSkeleton` and skeletonToMeshL. `makeLTreeSkeleton` creates a Tree with nodes determined by the phenotype and spine curve callback functions we pass to it. This function is recursive, calling `phenotype` for each branch. `phenotype` will return an array of child branches that determine the L-system structure. `skeletonToMeshL` takes a Tree skeleton and creates a Mesh for it, which can then be written to an OBJ or OFF file.

The SCGenerator class holds all of the logic for generating a tree with the space colonization algorithm. It has two main methods, `makeSCTreeSkeleton` which generates the set of points that will form the skeleton of the tree, and `skeletonToMeshSC` which adds the vertices and faces that correspond to the given skeleton. The goal of the space colonization algorithm is to model the structure of a mature tree through the competition of branches for space. This is accomplished by generating a set of anchor points that pull on nearby tree nodes, and deleting anchors when they get too close to the tree. The process is divied up into the following methods: `generateAnchors`, `findClosestNode`, `growTreeNodes`, and `killAnchors`. To add a greater density of small twigs and branches in our trees, we give the option of continuously adding new anchor points at each iteration, which uses the `intermediateAnchors` method.

To handle the logic of adding vertices and faces to a Mesh and writing the Mesh to a file in OFF format, we used Ben’s Mesh class from the Meshes lab. A `Vector` of `Point3`s is used to store the vertices and a `Vector` of `SmallArray`s of three `int`s, is used to store the faces. We also added a Face class to Mesh, which stores all the information we need to know about the faces of a mesh, including its points as well as its texture points. By having these classes, we do not have to write OFF or OBJ files of generated trees directly in our App class, which would make things messy and bulky.

Correctness Results
==================================
These images showcase the ability of our algorithms to generate a wide variety of trees, realistic and otherwise, controllable through the various parameters provided. These images of trees with wireframe shown demonstrate proper branch generation:

![Wireframe of leafless L-system tree](doc-files/LTreeWireframe.jpg width=400) 

![Wireframe of leafless SC-system tree](doc-files/SCTreeWireframe.jpg width=400)

For the L-system generation, the main parameters are recursion depth, phenotype, and spine curve. As recursion depth increases, the complexity and density of the trees increases. The phenotype and spine curves are categorical variables and vary the appearence of the tree uniquely.

The default parameters for the L-system tree are as follows:

1. Recursion Depth = 5
2. Phenotype = Normal
3. Spine Curve = Straight

![Default Tree](doc-files/Default-L.png width=600)

These images show the effect of varying each parameter on the default tree:

For the Space Colonization generation, the main parameters are number of anchor points, distance between tree nodes, anchor point kill distance, initial branch radius, radius growth factor, attraction radius, leafiness, discount rate, and envelope. As anchor points increases, the tree gets more dense. As the tree node distance increases, the branches get more segmented. As the kill distance increases, the branches have larger empty area around them. As initial branch radius increases the radius of the branches increases. As the radius growth factor increases, the growth of the branch radii decreases. As the attraction radius decreases, the tree becomes more gnarled. As leafiness increases the branch sections that spawn leaves occur further down the branches. As the discount rate increases, the tree spawns more small twigs and branches to fill out the tree. The envelope perimeter function is categorical and varys the appearence of the tree uniquely.

The default parameters for the space colonization tree are as follows:

1. Anchor Points = 1000
2. Tree Node Distance = 0.5
3. Kill Distance = 2
4. Initial Branch Radius = 0.01
5. Radius Growth Factor = 2
6. Attraction Radius = 100
7. Leafiness = 10
8. Discount Rate = 0.9
9. Envelope = Bulb
