**MVP Goals**
We will eventually be able to procedurally generate trees that look similar to these:

![](tree1.png)
![](tree2.jpg) ![](tree3.jpg) ![](tree4.jpg)

The leaves will be mapped onto quads, so they will look similar to this:

![](leaves1.jpg) ![](leaves2.jpg)

It is easy for us to imagine an algorithm to generate a tree by recursively adding smaller cylinders to a larger cylinder. However, to make a realistic tree, the branching has to be somewhat randomized.

We aim to be able to generate trees that don't look generic and have varying shapes and sizes, like these trees:

Quality Results
==================================
**Polish Goals**

For polish, we will map bark textures to our trees.

We also want the branches of our trees to be smoothly connected:

Evocative Result
==================================
For our custom scene, we would like to make an orchard with trees that grow different things. For example, we could have an apple tree, a money tree, a teapot tree, and a wine glass tree in our orchard. This will show the variation between same "species" of procedurally generated trees.

Additionally, we would like to make a forest of all types of different trees.

Finally, we think it would be cool to make trees with roots that are mapped to the surface of a sphere, or planet, like in the Little Prince.
