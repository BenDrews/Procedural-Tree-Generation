Specification
==================================

Topic Overview
==================================
**Tree Generation using L-Systems**

![L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) provide an easy way to generate plantlike structures. Nature often encorporates fractal patterns in how plants grow and branch, which translates easily into recursive method calls which mirror such growth on a mesh.

In order to set up this generation, a set of simple recusive rules must be written. These generally replace or grow a set of smaller branches off of a parent branch, and can be applied repeatedly to get increasingly detailed results.

**Tree Generation using Space Colonization**

![Space Colonization](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/colonization.egwnp2007.pdf) is an algorithm that attempts to model the competition by branches for space on a tree in its generation. It does a better job than L-Systems at modeling mature trees, since as plant mature, the factors limiting their growth start to weigh more heavily on how branches are placed than the factors creating opportunites for growth.

The algorithm works by randomly seeding a volume with anchor points, which pull on tree nodes, spawning adjacent tree nodes in the average direction of the anchor points pulling on that node. Once a tree node gets too close to an anchor node, than anchor is destroyed. This process repeats until all anchors are destroyed.

Design
==================================


Correctness Results
==================================
**MVP Goals**
We will eventually be able to procedurally generate trees that look similar to these:

![](tree1.png)
![](tree2.jpg) ![](tree3.jpg) ![](tree4.jpg)

The leaves will be mapped onto quads, so they will look similar to this:

It is easy for us to imagine an algorithm to generate a tree by recursively adding smaller cylinders to a larger cylinder. However, to make a realistic tree, the branching has to be somewhat randomized.

We aim to be able to generate trees that don't look generic and have varying shapes and sizes, like these trees:

Quality Results
==================================
**Polish Goals**

For polish, we will map bark textures to our trees.

We also want the branches of our trees to be smoothly connected:

Evocative Result
==================================
For our custom scene, we would like to make an orchard with trees that grow different things. For example, we could have an apple tree, a money tree, a teapot tree, and a wine glass tree in our orchard. This will show the variation between same "species" of procedurally generated trees.

![](design4.jpg)

Additionally, we would like to make a forest of all types of different trees.

Finally, we think it would be cool to make trees with roots that are mapped to the surface of a sphere, or planet, like in the Little Prince.
