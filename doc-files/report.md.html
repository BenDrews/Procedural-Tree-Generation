Introduction 
==================================




Specification
==================================

1. A user interface with the following controls:
    1. Integer number box for the max recursion depth
    2. Slider to use L-system generation or Space Colonization generation
    3. Tree phenotype dropdown list
    4. Generate button to start the generation 

2. When the "Generate" button is pressed, the program:
    1. Immediately displays a waiting screen
    2. Generates the tree
    3. Places it into the "tree testing" scene and loads that scene

3. Tree Generation
    1. makeTree function that starts the generation
    2. makeBranch function that adds a branch to the tree. Different functions can be made for different tree phenotypes.
    3. Mesh class that stores all the vertices and faces. This class also handles the actual file generation.
    4. makeCylindricSection function that adds a cylinder in a given coordinate frame to the Mesh.
    5. makeLeaves function that adds leaves to a second mesh object.

4. Output two OFF files, one for the tree branches, and one for the tree leaves.

Program Evaluation Metric:
- Graph the time it took to render a tree model versus the number of child branches with a set recursion depth of 7
- Graph the time it took to render a tree model versus the recursion depth with three child branches at each recursion.

Quality Results
==================================
**Polish Goals**

For polish, we will map bark textures to our trees.

We also want the branches of our trees to be smoothly connected:

Evocative Result
==================================
For our custom scene, we would like to make an orchard with trees that grow different things. For example, we could have an apple tree, a money tree, a teapot tree, and a wine glass tree in our orchard. This will show the variation between same "species" of procedurally generated trees.

Additionally, we would like to make a forest of all types of different trees.

Finally, we think it would be cool to make trees with roots that are mapped to the surface of a sphere, or planet, like in the Little Prince.

Change Log
==================================
1. Modified Mesh class from Ben's meshes lab to suit this projects needs. Added general program structure.
2. Fixed CFrame bug, cylindric sections will now generate at an angle
3. Fixed floating tree bug, child branches are now connected to their parents
4. Added leaf generation
5. Added rudimentary space colonization
