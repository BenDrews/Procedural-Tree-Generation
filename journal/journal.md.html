2016-09-19: Halo Ring
====================================================

For the custom scene, I simiply adjusted the `fromHeightField` method to map onto the inside of a ring to make a model similar to the Halo Ring from the game series Halo. Then I ran a once off method to generate the ring edge model.

2016-09-18: Glass Generation
=============================================================

To start developing this method, I made a helper, `addCylindricSection` to abstract away the addition of rings to the glass at varying radii and height. From there most of my time was spent working on how to pass a function as a parameter to define the edge of the glass with arbitrary position. After the method was created, more time was spent trying to tune the silouette function to generate a shape resembling a glass.

2016-09-18: Heightmap
=============================================================

Thanks to some good fortune, much of this method's logic was already written in last weeks lab. All that was required was a transposition to a `Mesh` object rather than a collection of cubes in a `Scene.Any` file, and the face definitions.

2016-09-18: Cylinder Generation
=============================================================

Once the actual `Mesh` class was completed it was simple to hook up to a set of vertices and generate the mesh. The difficulty here was getting the GUI components to work, but after a little tinkering and a lot of documentation reading, it all works.

2016-09-15: Mesh Class
=============================================================

Spent a lot of time figuring out how to create my own class and get it to interact with the `App` class. Eventually realized that although I had the header and source files in the same directory as the `App.h` and `App.cpp` files, they weren't in the Header and Source folders in the actually solution file. After that I worked on the actually logic for the `Mesh` class. The only difficulty encountered there was with `G3D::Array` which was giving me problems when I tried to make an array of `Poly` objects. Eventually I just changed the `G3D::Array` objects to `std::vector`.

2016-09-15: Learning `.OFF`
=============================================================

Read through `.OFF` documentation to learn the format. Encountered a parse error bug, which was caused by promising the file 6 faces and then only providing one. Once that was corrected I had my very own cube mesh.
