2016-10-06: Inital Design
=====================================================
**makeTree**
Parameters: branchLength, recursiveDepth

This method calls makeBranch and generates the final Mesh/OFF file that will contain our tree.

**makeBranch**
Parameters: Initial CoordinateFrame, length, callback function that returns a CoordinateFrame, callback function that returns the radius of the branch at that point, Mesh that we're adding to, number of points around the circle, number of sections around the curve

This method will call Ben's addCylindricSection method.

When the method reaches zero recursive depth, it calls addLeaves to add leaves to the end of the branch.


2016-10-06: Inital Planning
=====================================================
**MVP Goals**
We will eventually be able to procedurally generate trees that look similar to these:

![](tree1.png)
![](tree2.jpg) ![](tree3.jpg) ![](tree4.jpg)

The leaves will be mapped onto quads, so they will look similar to this:

![](leaves1.jpg) ![](leaves2.jpg)

It is easy for us to imagine an algorithm to generate a tree by recursively adding smaller cylinders to a larger cylinder. However, to make a realistic tree, the branching has to be somewhat randomized.

We aim to be able to generate trees that don't look generic and have varying shapes and sizes, like these trees:

**Polish Goals**

For polish, we will map bark textures to our trees.

We also want the branches of our trees to be smoothly connected:

For our custom scene, we would like to make an orchard with trees that grow different things. For example, we could have an apple tree, a money tree, a teapot tree, and a wine glass tree in our orchard. This will show the variation between same "species" of procedurally generated trees.

Additionally, we would like to make a forest of all types of different trees.

Finally, we think it would be cool to make trees with roots that are mapped to the surface of a sphere, or planet, like in the Little Prince.
