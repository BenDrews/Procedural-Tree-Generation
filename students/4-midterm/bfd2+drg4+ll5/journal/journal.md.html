Self Evaluation
==================================
We deserve an A- on the midterm. Our specification was ambitious because we wanted to include many parameters in our tree generation algorithms. We managed our workflow quite well and worked efficiently by dividing tasks between team members. We were able to generate MVP trees within two days of work, giving us a lot of time to polish and address all of our original specification goals, and even add space colonization to it. However, we underestimated how long it would take for us to finish the report and make our custom scenes. In the next project, we should know when to stop polishing our program and allot more time for working on the custom scenes and report. Our code is readable, well-structured, and demonstrates our clear understanding of two different algorithms for tree generation. Although there are parameter combinations that generate outputs that don’t look good, the program functions well and is bug-free. Our report is concise and looks very professional (thanks to Markdeep!), but it could be more thorough.

While working on this project, we learned about different tree generation algorithms, how to design our own project, and work in a group. While working in a group, unlike while pair programming, we programmed independently and had to later deal with merging and resolving conflicts. We also gained experience with referencing outside sources to find more sophisticated ways of modeling trees.


2016-10-18: Adding more fruit options (Lylia)
====================================================
To add some options for which kind of fruit tree to generate, I added an orchard tab to the GUI that has a drop down menu with all the options. I also wrote a new class, FruitDimensions, that stores each fruit's filename and how it should be scaled and rotated. I added an instance variable to App that holds an array of FruitDimensions. The indices of the FruitDimensions in the Array correspond to the indices of the names of the fruits in the drop down menu. The names of the fruits in the drop down menu are also the names of the folders where they are located in data-files/models folder.

I downloaded some free fruit 3D models from TurboSquid, but the texture mapping for some of them (the apple and banana, to be specific) don't work for some reason. In my opinion the best looking fruits are the pear, lemon, and "wild dollar stacks."


2016-10-16: Making trees with fruits (Lylia)
====================================================
To make our trees start growing fruits, I added an extra parameter to makeTree and makeBranch. It is an Array of Point3s which stores the locations of where fruits would be placed with respect to the coordinate frame of the base of the tree. The Array is populated on the call of makeBranch at recursion depth 1, at the same time at which leaves are added to the tree.

![A teapot tree](treesWithFruits.png)

To add some variation between trees, I use a G3D::Random to choose an integer in the range [-2, 1] and only if the integer is 1 do I actually place a fruit in the scene. As a result, different trees grow fruits in different places.

The next steps are to add functionality for adding different types of fruit (instead of just teapot fruits), and add random rotations of the fruits so they don't all face in the same direction.

2016-10-16: Starting the custom scene (Lylia)
====================================================
To start our orchard scene, I added a function generateOrchard to the App class which generates a Scene.Any file with any number of rows of trees in it. I pretty much just took the function I had written in the first Cubes lab to procedurally generate a bookshelf and edited it to add many trees instead of many books.

2016-10-16: Space Colonization Take 2 (Ben)
===========================================================
After numerous pointer abuses, the Space Colonization algorithm finally output a skeleton. The very first attempt to lay a mesh over skeleton was plagued by a +1 error that resulted in one long tube being threaded through all the vertices.
>>>>>>> .r1726

![Attempt 1](SColAttempt1.jpg)

After that was resolved, the circles for each cylindric section weren't being rotated correctly so we ended up with branches that looked like ribbon pasta.

![Fettuccini Tree](FettucciniTree.jpg)

After a bit of tuning they look better, but I have a feeling the trigonometry is still a bit off. GUI elements were also added to allow variation in the Space Colonization algorithm's parameters.

![Space Colonization At Work](SColTreeNoLeaves.jpg)

Bugs of note: The algorithm is prone to non-terminal behavior on occasion. This manifests as each iteration adding nodes in the exact same place to the exact same parent. To deal with this there is a check in the algorithm that terminates the loop if no anchor points are deleted for 100 iterations in a row. This should probably be changed to a check for if a node gets added in the same place to the same parent. When this behavior occurs, it can be observed in the tree structure as braches that for seemingly no reason balloon out. This bug occurs much more often when there is a low effective kill distance. (Kill distance * Tree Node Distance).

![Bug Symptom](SColBugPicture.jpg)

Added Leaves. The paradigm used for placing leaves in the L-System trees doesn't quite translate.

2016-10-16: One OBJ file instead of Two (Diego)
====================================================
To do this, I added an addMesh method to the mesh class. What that method did was it first took note of how many vertices already existed. Then it added that number to each face point from the added mesh. This is because the leaf vertices were being added to the tree vertices and the order matters for the face points. Then it added all the vertices and all the faces to our arrays. This went pretty smoothly, so now we have our trees being generated with only one OBJ file.

![](oneObjFile.png)


2016-10-16: Fixing the Mesh bug (Diego)
=====================================================
After discussing the bug with Ben, we realized that we actually had two bugs. One was that we were drawing our faces backwards, but another made an inverted face before making any other faces. These two bugs masked eachother. This one time, two wrongs made an almost right. To fix this, I fixed the order of the points when adding the face to the obj file and instead of building our branches from the top down, we built them from the bottom up.

![](meshBugFix.png)

You can also now see that our quadratic interpolation is making a slight curve to our branch radii, exactly as we wanted!


2016-10-15: Adding textures (Diego)
=====================================================
I added textures to the OBJ files by making an MTL file and finding some bump maps online. For now, I'm simply adding the texture to each face of each branch section. A better way might be to stretch it out along the branch, but that's work for another day. To do this, I edited the Mesh Class to have an included Face class that stores the texture coordinates and what kind of texture each face has. This is to make consolidating the two obj files into one easier down the line.

![](texture.png)

Those black boxes have to do with my G3D. I'm going to update before moving on.

Side note: At one point I was looking for how to add an alpha mask to an MTL file. I googled that questions and I found a Casual Effects post by Morgan. Thanks 2012 Morgan for helping me with that!


2016-10-14: Add realistic branch radii (Diego)
=====================================================
Ben showed me a paper that said that the radius of a branch is the square root of of all its children's radii squared summed together. I added this and made each branch linearly interpolate between its base radius and its child radii. This looked pretty good

![](realisticTreeRadii.png)

But unfortunately, it didn't result in good looking trees once the recursion level was raised.

![](bigRecursionRadii.png)

I added code to make the interpolation be quadratic to result in a smoother transition, but it didn't seem to work. After adding in more branch sections, no aparent change was shown. After checking the wireframe, there only seemed to be one branch section.

![](oneBranchSection.png)

After looking around, I noticed where the extra branch sections were going, onto the backfaces.

![](backfaceBranchSections.png)

This is a bug for another day. I'll add it to the list.


2016-10-13: Space Colonization Take 1 (Ben)
===========================================================
A Tree data structure has been made to help with storing the tree node skeleton. Logic exists to perform the skeleton creating algorithm, but there currently is a bug where after the first iteration, subsequent iterations do not properly update the children array.


2016-10-13: Adding some GUI (Lylia)
=====================================================
I added GUI to the App class that control several parameters for tree creation, including the max recursion depth, initial height of the tree, number of circle points in the generated cylinders, number of branch sections, and a drop-down list to choose different phenotype callback functions.


2016-10-13: Abstracting makeBranch method (Lylia)
=====================================================
Broke up the makeBranch method so that it takes a callback function that determines the dimensions of the branches it makes in the recursive calls of makeBranch. This will allow us to write different callback functions to specify the rotation and translation of the next branches, how many next branches there will be, and what their lengths will be in relation to the previous branch. Each callback function will return an array of BranchDimensions, which is a new class I wrote to hold the CoordinateFrames and lengths of the next branches that will be made.

The first callback function I implemented was Diego's spiky tree:

![Spiky tree generated with 4 recursive calls](spikyTreeCallback4.png width=300px) ![Spiky tree generated with 7 recursive calls](spikyTreeCallback7.png width=300px)

I'm not sure if this is exactly how Diego's spiky tree looked before I abstracted parts of makeBranch, so I'll have to check with him to verify that all is well. 


2016-10-13: Adding OBJ file support (Diego)
=====================================================
Added OBJ file support to the Mesh class. This required me to read up on the OBJ file format but once I understood how to declare the vertices and the faces, the transition to OBJ from OFF was fairly simple. There is no texture support yet, but Ben will work on that tomorrow.


2016-10-10: Adding Leaves (Diego)
===========================================================
To add leaves, all we're going to do is have a separate OFF file. At the last recursion level, we will add a double sided triangle straight up in the coordinate frame given by the branches. Then in the scene, we will just put the two models at the same position, one colored brown and the other colored green.

Implementing this was fairly easy given how we set up our recursive branch function. 

![](firstLeaves.png)

The leaves' sizes were decided based on the length given to it by its parent branch. After seeing the first result, I decided to make the leaves a little bigger.

![](secondLeaves.png)

Then just for fun, I decided to see how the leaves looked with different rule sets.

![](thirdLeaves.png)

![](fourthLeaves.png)


2016-10-10: Playing with recursion levels and new lengths (Diego)
==============================================================
By upping the recursion levels to 10 and making the new lengths of branches 4/5 of the old branch length, we got this bush structure

![](accidentalBush.png)

By taking the same exact rule set and just changing the new lengths of branches to be 3/5 of the old branch length, we got this tree structure

![](accidentalRealTree.png)


2016-10-09: Debugging our Tree pt2 (Ben + Diego)
==========================================================
So the issue with our floating trees from before was that instead of moving the coordinate frames to the branch end, we were simply translating them by that distance. This was fixed by setting the translation of the coordinate frames to be at the end of the branch.

![](goodTree.png)


2016-10-08: Debugging our Tree (Diego)
===========================================================
So for some reason our trees are looking like this:

![](secondTree.png)

For debugging purposes, I made a tree with no branches with a pitch of 30 degrees.

![](branchEndBug.png)

So it seems like the coordinate frame translation is our issue. After looking through the code, I noticed that we had one coordinate frame for our branch start and one for our branch end. To fix this, I simply made one coordinate frame for the entire branch.

![](floatingTrees.png)

After fixing that bug, the second set of branches are floating above their parent branch. I was wondering if it had to do with the rotation of the second set of branches, so I rotated the entire set of branches.

![](rotatedTree.png)

So it has nothing to do with that, and is something to do with how the recursion is handled.


2016-10-06: Inital Design (Ben + Diego + Lylia)
=====================================================
**makeTree**
Parameters: branchLength, recursiveDepth

This method calls makeBranch and generates the final Mesh/OFF file that will contain our tree.

**makeBranch**
Parameters: Initial CoordinateFrame, length, callback function that returns a CoordinateFrame, callback function that returns the radius of the branch at that point, Mesh that we're adding to, number of points around the circle, number of sections around the curve

This method will call Ben's addCylindricSection method.

When the method reaches zero recursive depth, it calls addLeaves to add leaves to the end of the branch.

After adding our code, the tree we generate looks like this:

![](firstTree.png)


2016-10-06: Inital Planning (Ben + Diego + Lylia)
=====================================================
**MVP Goals**
We will eventually be able to procedurally generate trees that look similar to these:

![](tree1.png)
![](tree2.jpg) ![](tree3.jpg) ![](tree4.jpg)

The leaves will be mapped onto quads, so they will look similar to this:

![](leaves1.jpg) ![](leaves2.jpg)

It is easy for us to imagine an algorithm to generate a tree by recursively adding smaller cylinders to a larger cylinder. However, to make a realistic tree, the branching has to be somewhat randomized.

We aim to be able to generate trees that don't look generic and have varying shapes and sizes, like these trees:

![](design1.jpg)
![](design2.jpg)

**Polish Goals**

For polish, we will map bark textures to our trees.

We also want the branches of our trees to be smoothly connected:

![](curvegoals.jpg)

For our custom scene, we would like to make an orchard with trees that grow different things. For example, we could have an apple tree, a money tree, a teapot tree, and a wine glass tree in our orchard. This will show the variation between same "species" of procedurally generated trees.

![](design4.jpg)

Additionally, we would like to make a forest of all types of different trees.

Finally, we think it would be cool to make trees with roots that are mapped to the surface of a sphere, or planet, like in the Little Prince.
